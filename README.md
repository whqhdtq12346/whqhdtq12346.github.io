## Introduction
Hello, my name is Bong-seop Jo and I entered the Software Department of SKKU in 2020. My motto is to try to see the things broadly, since there are multiple perspectives on everything.
My strength is being able to use creative and flexible thinking in any difficulty. I have developed the ability to calmly analyze and find solutions even in the situation that I have never experienced before.
