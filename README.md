## Introduction
Hello, my name is Bong-seop Jo and I entered the Software Department of SKKU in 2020. I'm interested in individual game development.
My motto is to try to see the things broadly, since there are multiple perspectives on everything. My strength is being able to use creative and flexible thinking in any difficulty.\
I like drawing some natural or artificial things. By drawing complex structures, I improved my ability to analyze elements in detail and see them from a new perspective. Since I was young, I like to create something that I imagined and it affects me to decide my career path to Computer Science. Also I enjoy listening musics of various genres and playing chess.
